            <h2>St. Thomas' Girls School </h2>
            <p>I have always loved Maths and Computer Science. So, during my school days I would love attending the Maths and computer science classes.</p>

                <h4>A memoriable memory</h4>
                <p>School days are the best days in any person's life. I have enjoyed my school days to the fullest and the most memoriable memory I have during my time in school is finishing lunch before lunch break.
                    My friends and I would be sitting in the last bench and having each other's lunch during class hiding from the teacher. Ah! those were fun days...

            <h2>St. Thomas College of Engineering & Technology </h2>
            <p>My favourite classes in college were the advanced Maths, Java, Database and Algorithms classes. I also enjoyed the labs we got to do..</p>
            <aside>
                <h4>A memoriable memory</h4>
                <p>College was very different from school, but I loved the fact that I got to meet so many new people and learn so many new things. I don't really have a particular memoriable memory, but there were many moments that are memoriable . Our department had an amazing unity that we even got praised by our director during graduation. Ofcourse in class every one had their set of friends and groups that were always together, but our we as a department had an amazing unity. 
                    From helping each other in labs, making notes for exam preparations, to getting in  trouble we would always be together. I remember this one time, when a few students had bunked classes. Our director(who was very strict) has called the entire class to ask who were the ones who had bunked. He had said if the students did not step up, or if people who knew who these students were don't speak up the entire class will be severely punished. 
                    Well guess what happened next!! No one said a thing and we all got punished... Well, we were a class where we never ratted about each other. We ofcourse were fierce competitors and had our fare share of fights among each other but when it came to stand together, we would always be there and have each others back. And what was amazing about this way, since the first day the unity had always been there, and we were a class of 62 students and all were strangers except for one or two who came from the same school.

            <h2>Stevens Institute of Technology </h2>
            <p>My favourite class so far is Web programming and Cybersecurity. I am also working on a research project in AI and I am really enjoying my journal meetings and the fact that I am getting to learn so much.</p>

                <h4>A memoriable memory</h4>
                <p>We I have just started my journey in Stevens, so I don't really have a memoriable memory, but I love the fact how helpful everyone here is. From professors to students, everyone is very helpful. I also like the fact that so many opportunities are availabe if one is willing to work hard towards their goals. I am grateful for the opportuniy I got and I appreciate every moment that I am living it.
