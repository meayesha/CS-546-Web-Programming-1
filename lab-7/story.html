    <h1> How I got myself a pet parrot</h1>

                This is the story about how I got my pet parrot. I had a pet store near my house and while coming back from school, I would always make sure to go athere and play with the animals there.
                One day, I saw that they had rescued some baby parrots. As usual I went to play them and one of the babies just hopped on my hand and stayed there. It would get back down. Every time I put it down it would just hop back up. 
               It was love at first sight!! 
            </p>
            <p> I decided to go back home and convince my mom, to get the parrot for me. She was absolutely against the idea but I had made up my mind. After a lot of tears, and arguments I was finally able to convince her to buy me the bird. I
                decided to name it Litu!!! And now it has been 13 years that it with me. A loyal friend and companion. Although, if you give him food he will be your friend too but he won't let you pet him. Only my mom and I can pet him. He knows how to speak too. He loves to eat fruits. He has to take a shower everyday or else he will scream his head off. 
                he is the cutest

                Now that I am away from I miss him a lot... I miss petting him and playing with him. Sometimes when i video call my mom I would speak with him and he would reply back. But I don't do that quite often because after speaking with me he realises that I am actually not there and he would get upset and not eat the whole day. 
                I did not know birds have seperation anxiety as well. I love my Litu and I am glad that I had decided to get him...
